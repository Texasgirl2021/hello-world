Class assignment
I am a 38 year old woman who loves to learn and laugh a lot. I am studying computer science at Ivy Tech Community College in hopes to obtain my associates degree. This is a more challenging course I am taking and want to do well in it. I hope to learn new skills from this site and use them one day in my field. God is good and I know he will see me thru.
